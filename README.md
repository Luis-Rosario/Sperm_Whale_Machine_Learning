# Sperm Whale Machine Learning
Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus) Machine Learning Algorithms

Code repository for Scientific Reports publication: "Deep Machine Learning Techniques for the Detection and Classification of Sperm Whale Bioacoustics" by Peter C. Bermant, Michael M. Bronstein, Robert J. Wood, Shane Gero, and David F. Gruber.

This repository contains the codes for the CNN-based detection of sperm whale echolocation clicks and the RNN-based classification of sperm whale codas according to coda type, vocal clan, and whale identity.

Examples are provided as comments in the code. Datasets are included in the Supplementary Information.
